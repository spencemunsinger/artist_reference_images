These are images exported from Capture One from Painting_Reference_images_20241125.cosessiondb

They are 1280px long edge.  They are exported at 92% quality.  The images are referenced on a
calibrated display and end up with minimal changes, a slight increase in contrast, saturation and clarity.

From here they are processed by bash imagemagick scripts and placed in spencemunsinger.com_source-images
with multiple sizes and transparent or solid matching backgrounds, and webp and jpg (solid) or png (transparent)
backgrounds.

The export from Capture One places images in dsm/projects/export_from_Capture_One folder. Moved from there to here.
Naming is by "Description" in metadata, which is set to the painting title.
